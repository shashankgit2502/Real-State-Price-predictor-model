Machine Learning Project 1

Test Case - we will be creating a predict model.
    the customer runs a real state company, where he wants to give many features as an input and in return wants the model to predict the price of the property.

Type of Model to use - 
1. Supervised Model
2. Regression task
3. Batch Learning

Selecting a perfromance measure:
1. RMSE (Root Mean Sqaure Error) - generally prefered for regression task

Checking the assumptions.

# We will be using boston housing data set.
